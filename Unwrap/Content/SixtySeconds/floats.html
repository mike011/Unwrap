<p>The <code>Float</code> data type stores low-precision decimal numbers such as 3.1, 3.14159 and 556.9. It is not used that often in Swift, partly because <code>Double</code> is the default for these kinds of numbers (it has a higher precision), and partly because when you come across libraries that use regular floats they are more likely to want <code>CGFloat</code> instead.</p
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="code">
<p></p>
<p><span class="keyword">let</span> pi<span class="punctuation">:</span> <span class="builtin">Float</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="string">3.141</span></p>
<p></p>
</pre>
